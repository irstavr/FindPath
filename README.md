# Finding paths in a maze
Given a complex maze, we find a path between two points and calculate this distance, in Prolog.


Usage:

Load code included in repository:

Load solver:

| ?- consult(solveMaze.pl).

To test every possible path of the maze, run:

| ?- print_paths.

To check all the distances between every possible path on the maze, run:

| ?- print_distances.

Solutions will be written on the output.
